                <p>
                    Apart of some of my freelance work, I for a moment joined the Sabanetics team as a graphic designer and was commsioned to do various mockups for them. During which I was given the opportunity to work in a large group of about ten or so people and got quite a bit of design advice from fellow creators who had much more experience than me at the time. Many of the works that I did for them was focused around flat and material design and I began to think much more critically about what I made from that point on.
